						<h3>Millions Drop Out Of School After Attaining Puberty</h3>
						<h4>Saadhvi Ramkumar</h4>
						<h5>Date Published: 1/3/2021</h5>
						<div style="height:300px; width:95%; border:1px solid #ccc; font:14px/26px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; overflow:auto;">
						<p>Each year, over 20 million girls drop out of school in rural India once they attain puberty. This usually occurs at the young age of 10-12 years, so they miss out on a large and important portion of their education. The impacts this has on their future are large and many, ranging from the inability to get a job to increased risk of legal trouble later on in their lives. </p>
						<p>
						One of the biggest causes of this issue is the unavailability of sanitary napkins and/or other period products. Only a mere 12% of India’s menstruating population has access to safe period products due to a variety of reasons. The high cost of these products makes them inaccessible to people of lower economic standings, who essentially make up the vast majority of India’s population. Since people in rural areas do not have access to these products, they revert to old rags or socks stuffed with rice to catch their blood. Not only does this hinder them while they perform their daily activities, but is also is an extremely unhygienic solution that can lead to a myriad of infections. </p>
						<p>
						Even if sanitary napkins were available, most government schools in rural areas do not have toilets with running water for girls to change their napkins in. 
						In addition to all this, the general taboo surrounding the topic leads to low awareness of the whole idea. High percentages of menstruating mothers consider menstruation to be “dirty” and this leads to many girls not knowing about it until the onset of their periods. The majority of the schools in rural areas do not educate their students about menstruation either, which also leads to low awareness levels. 
						Most people consider it easier to stay at home and help out than to go to school in pain and while feeling ashamed or dirty. In most places, this drop out is not even a choice but is simply regarded as the norm once girls reach a menstruating age. It’s often regarded as something you are required to do not for yourself, but to make sure your impure presence is not around other people. </p>
						<p>
						This issue is deeply rooted in several others like misogyny, poor education on reproductive health, and the spreading of misinformation on this topic. All of these can be properly addressed by simple things such as spreading factually accurate information on topics as important as period hygiene, making sanitary products more available to people of lower economic standing, and breaking down the general disgust and taboo around periods. Not all of these things are achievable overnight, but small steps count as progress, and everyone is capable of doing something to contribute towards the bigger picture.
