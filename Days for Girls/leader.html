						<h5>Founded Club in 2020</h5>

						<p>
							I created this club because I felt that there was a need in our privileged community to raise awareness about period poverty. I have always been passionate about feminism and menstrual issues and thought that students at Northwood should be provided with the opportunity to help support women with their menstrual care needs through this initiative.

						<p>
							I joined this club because I think it is really important to raise awareness about menstrual poverty around the world. I think we need to help people that don’t get the same privileges as us.

						<h4>Tuba Harisci</h4>

						<p>
							I joined this club because the mission of Days for Girls is really meaningful and raises awareness about a really important issue that is not talked about enough.

						<h2>Secretary</h2>
						<h4>Irene Ryu</h4>

						<p>
							I joined this club because I think period poverty is not talked about enough and want to remove the idea that period products are a luxury.

						<h2>Publicist</h2>
						<h4>Rachel Huh</h4>

						<p>
							I joined this club because I wanted to spread awareness about period poverty, which is something that isn’t talked about often. I want to support women around the world with their menstrual needs even if it’s through publicizing or donating period kits.

						<h2>Treasurer</h2>
						<h4>Sumedha Chalasani</h4>

						<p>
							I joined this club because I have always thought about period poverty since I watched a short documentary about it a few years ago. By joining, I could help to combat it.

						<p>
							I joined this club because even though we are privileged enough here in California, many people around the world don’t have the resources they need, and because we do, I think we should share them and help out in any way we can.

						<p>
							I joined this club because I think we have a privilege here in Irvine and we should attempt to share our resources to places in need.
